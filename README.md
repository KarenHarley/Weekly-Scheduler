# Weekly Scheduler

## Description

This application is designed to help organize your weekly schedule and tasks efficiently. It allows you to create tasks for specific time intervals (hours or 30-minute blocks) and add notes for additional details. You can also break down larger tasks into smaller, manageable sub-tasks. Tasks are organized by day of the week and stored in a database, enabling access across multiple devices. The application features a completion check function to track progress. Additionally, it incorporates the Covey Time Management Matrix, categorizing tasks by importance and urgency to enhance productivity.
